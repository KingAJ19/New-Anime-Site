						<p><i>"Sakura is trash"</i>, <i>"Sakura is useless"</i>, <i>"All she does is cry"</i>. As fans of the Naruto anime, I'm sure we've all heard those things, or more, being said about Sakura by fans of the anime itself. Is there any validity to those claims or is it just a thing that people just say in order to be funny? Well, that's what I'm going to figure out and also give my thoughts & opinions on Sakura.</p>
				        <img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/Sakura/Sakura-H.jpg" alt="Picture of Sakura">
                    </br>
                    </br>
					</br>
				        <p>First of all, let's just debunk the <b>biggest</b> lie from all of these claims - <i>"Sakura is weak."</i>. That's 100% cap. Sakura is the strongest female character, in terms of strength & power, in the whole anime and on top of that, she's the best medic ninja as well. She saved Naruto's life during the 4th Ninja War:</p>

				        <img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/Sakura/sakura-healing-naruto.jpg" alt="Sakura saving Naruto's life">
						<p>And for the strength part, she beat one of my favorite Akatsuki members, Sasori, basically on her own <i>(I mean, Lady Chiho was there but she didn't do much fighting)</i>:</p>
						
						<img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/Sakura/sakura-beating-sasori.jpg" alt="Sakura beating Sasori">
						<p>People would usually choose Hinata over Sakura, in terms of looks and stuff, but I think we all know Sakura would one-shot Hinata and almost every other female in the anime. Like I said, she's really strong later on in Shippuden but the Sakura dislike really started in <i>Naruto</i> and that's where all this Sakura hate manifested from.</p>
						<br>
						<p>Sakura and Naruto, <i>a.k.a the main character</i>, never really got along. Well, it's more like Sakura didn't like because he was annoying and she treated him so badly, which I didn't like since I knew what Naruto has been through. Here is how Sakura reacted when Naruto was taking a tough test: </p>
						<img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/Sakura/sakura-laughing-at-naruto.jpg" alt="Sakura laughing at Naruto">
						<p>Also, she made fun of him being an orphan: </p>
						<img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/Sakura/sakua-making-fun-of-naruto.jpg" alt="Sakura makig fun of Naruto">
						<p>It was kinda obvious at the beginning that Naruto liked Sakura. I'm pretty sure the writers wanted to do a <i>love triangle</i> between the three of them. Which never ends well for one person and that person happens to be Naruto:</p>
						<img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/Sakura/naruto-sad-at-sakura-and-sasuke.png" alt="Naruto sad at Sakura and Sasuke">
						<p>On the topic of Sasuke, I don't blame Sakura for liking Sasuke because she can do whatever she wants but what I don't like is how much she <b>SIMPS</b> for Sasuke when he clearly doesn't care about her at all. It's honestly so annoying. For the most part, being in love with Sasuke was her personality. After Sakura made fun of Naruto for not having parents, this is what Sasuke said to Sakura:</p>
						<img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/Sakura/sasuke-youre-annoying.png" alt="Sasuke tells Sakura she's annoying">
						<p>After being told that, you'd think that she'd stop simping for him since he clearly doesn't like her at all. She did reflect on what he said though:</p>
						<img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/Sakura/sakura-reflecting-after-being-called-annoying.png" alt="Sakura reflects on being called annoying">
						<p>Buuuut we all know that nothing really changed at all and she was still her <i>"Sasuke~kun"</i> self that we all knew and hated. </p>
						<p>There's also this one scene from Naruto that is always used in the <i>'Sakura is trash'</i> argument. It's where Team 7 got ambushed in the Forest Of Death and Sakura was being held by the hair. Sakura had so many openings: </p>
						<img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/Sakura/Sakura-forest-cut-hair-1.jpg" alt="Sakura in forest of death">
						<p>But this is what she did instead:</p>
						<img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/Sakura/sakura-forest-cut-hair-2.jpg" alt="Sakura in forest of death">
						<p>There is a reason why she did it <i>("Sakura has to defend herself and her teammates. Kin Tsuchi, takes hold of her hair and insults her for spending so much time on her looks. This remark spurs her into cutting her hair to free herself from Kin's grasp.")</i> and you'd expect her to go beast mode after doing something like that but she got beat to near-death by Zaku ðŸ’€</p>
						<br>
						<p>Other things about Sakura is that she just cries and she doesn't contribute to anything when it actually matters. E.g: </p>
						<img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/Sakura/sakura-crying-for-naruto.jpg" alt="Sakura crying for Naruto-manga">
						<img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/Sakura/sakura-crying-for-naruto-2.jpg" alt="Sakura crying for Naruto">
						<p>To be fair, there was probably nothing that Sakura could have done in that situation but it's the fact that she just cried for Naruto instead of doing literally<i>anything</i>. Kakashi was never going to beat Pain but he still fought. Choji & his dad still fought. Tsunade swung at Pain. Konohamaru even beat one of the pains. Hinata, who Sakura would one-shot, fought against Pain when Naruto needed help:</p>
						<img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/Sakura/Hinata_protecting_Naruto.png" alt="Hinata fighting Pain">
						<br>
						<br>
						<p>In the 4th Ninja War arc, Obito wanted Sakura to destroy his Rinnegan before Zetsu takes over his body. Keep in mind that Obito wasn't resisting or trying to kill her - he just wanted her to destroy his eyes but she couldn't even do that <b>simple</b> task. </p>
						<img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/Sakura/sakura-obito-rinnegan.jpg" alt="Sakura not destroying Obito's eyes">
						<p>Here is Obito himself telling her to destroy his eyes <i>(before Madara can take them)</i>:</p>
						<img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/Sakura/sakura-obito-rinnegan-2.jpg" alt="Sakura not destroying Obito's eyes">
						<p>Even after Sasuke left the village and became a member of the Akatsuki, she was still simping for him and refused to believe that he'd gone rouge. That never made sense to me because Sasuke couldn't care less about her but yet she can't seem to just stop wanting him</p>
						<img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/Sakura/sakura-annoying-1.jpg" alt="Sakura annoying">
						<p>And there she goes crying again. It just doesn't make any sense why she still likes Sasuke. Sasuke even tried to kill her:</p>
						<img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/Sakura/sasuke-satbbing-sakura.jpg" alt="Sasuke almost killing Sakura">
						<p>That should be clear enough evidence as to how little Sasuke cares about Sakura but here's what he said himself about her:</p>
						<img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/Sakura/sasuke-rejecting-sakura.jpg" alt="Sasuke rejecting Sakura">
						<p>And last but definitely not least:</p>
						<img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/Sakura/sakura-saying-she-loves-naruto.jpg" alt="Sakura telling Naruto she loves him">
						<p>I don't even have to explain that one. I think that was the final nail in the coffin for the Sakura haters and it's fair too since she hasn't had any reason to feel like tht and even Naruto knew that she was lying:</p>
						<img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/Sakura/naruto-rejects-sakura.jpg" alt="Naruto rejecting Sakura">
						<br>
						<p><b>So here's my opinion on all this</b>... I don't like Sakura's character. She's so badly written and if you think otherwise then I don't know what to tell you. It's not Sakura's fault <i>(I mean, she's a fictional character</i>ðŸ’€) but the writers did her so dirty with how they portrayed her. She was always abusing Naruto and making fun of him, which was probably intended to be funny but it just got annoying after a while. Also, her obsession with Sasuke is what I really dislike about her. It's like her most of her personality is being in love with him. All in all, her character is just annoying in general and she'd be fine if she wasn't part of Team 7 but she is. She's considered to be a <i>"main character"</i> but when she's so trash, personality wise, she just looks like bad compared to the two other main characters. And to end this off, I present to you <b>the biggest lie ever told in anime history</b>:</p>
